# Postpartum-Maternal-Health-Analysis (Clustering with Partitional Algorithm)

## Project Objective

This project aims to analyze the condition of postpartum maternal health based on age distribution across various districts and cities. By applying a partitional clustering algorithm, the study segments data to uncover patterns in maternal health conditions, risk factors, and regional disparities.

## Key Questions (KPIs)

## physicochemical
- What age groups are most affected by postpartum complications?
- How does maternal health differ across urban and rural districts?
- based on cluster groupings?
- Can partitional clustering reveal hidden patterns to support targeted public health policies?

## Project Process

1. **Data Collection**
   - Gathered postpartum maternal health data by region, age group, and health outcome status.
   - Collected from regional health databases or synthetic data simulation for study purposes.

2. **Data Preparation**
   - Cleaned missing or inconsistent records.
   - Normalized and encoded age groups and health indicators.

3. **Clustering Method**
   - Applied partitional clustering algorithm (e.g., K-Means) to segment maternal health data.
   - Determined optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method or Silhouette Score.

4. **Analysis & Visualization**
   - Visualized cluster patterns using scatter plots, heatmaps, and region maps.
   - Interpreted each cluster’s characteristics: age concentration, risk level.

5. **Insight & Policy Implication**
   - Identified high-risk groups and underperforming districts.
   - Proposed data-driven recommendations for maternal care programs and health resource allocation.
