# Postpartum-Maternal-Health-Analysis (Clustering with Partitional Algorithm)

## Project Objective

This project aims to analyze the condition of postpartum maternal health based on age distribution across various districts and cities. By applying a partitional clustering algorithm, the study segments data to uncover patterns in maternal health conditions, risk factors, and regional disparities.
